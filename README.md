# The Written Analysis
# School_District_Analysis.

## Overview of the school district analysis:

The school board has informed Maria and her supervisor that the students complete.csv file contains evidence of academic dishonesty, with reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders seeming to have been tampered with. Despite the fact that the school board is unaware of the entire scope of the academic dishonesty, they are committed to upholding state testing standards and have sought Maria's assistance. Maria has requested that I change the math and reading results for Thomas High School with NaNs while maintaining the rest of the data.  In this analysis I will redo the school district analysis that I conducted in this lesson and produce a report describing how the adjustments affected the overall analysis once I have updated the math and reading scores. 

## Results:
